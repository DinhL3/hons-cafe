## Demo: [Hon's Caf√© on Netlify](https://hons-cafe.netlify.app/)  
Backend code: [Github](https://github.com/lqdquangdinh/hons-cafe-backend)

## 1. Overview
This is a coffee shop website built with React (styling with Sass modules, minimal use of styling libraries), Node.js, and MongoDB. It allows users to register new accounts, log in, view drinks, add drinks to cart, and check out using PayPal. The website is also responsive, supporting most devices' screens.

## 2. Responsiveness
Many components have different designs for desktop, tablet, and mobile. For example, the top navigation bar on desktop will become a side menu on mobile.

## 3. User Authentication
Some features, like adding drinks to cart, requires a logged in user (not realistic, only for demonstration purpose). The log in and registration form has interactive error handling.

## 6. PayPal integration
Clicking the "PayPal" button will open a PayPal window to order the items, like most e-commerce platforms would. Requires a PayPal sandbox account to make a dummy payment.
